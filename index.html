        <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the
            physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of
            science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from
            other natural phenomena.</p>

        <p>Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we
            irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our
            health, happiness and prosperity. These natural assets are often called the world's 'natural capital'.</p>
